# Lidar Processing
This is a simple project that use an Arduino UNO connected to a HC-SR04 ping sensor and a servomotor.
The Arduino UNO move the servo motor, and read the distance with ultrasonic sensor.
After send the values to the Processing program, by using Serial connection.

# Instructions
1. Upload the code in the Arduino UNO board
2. Open the Processing program, read the serial devices in the console
3. Select the correct number for Arduino UNO serial
4. Reload Processing program, and see the resuslt

# To do
1. Use another servo to add a movement to the sensor. After that you can scan entire volume.
2. Try to use a different sensor to improve quality of mesures
